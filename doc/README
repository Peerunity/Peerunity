Intro
-----
PeerUnity is a dual-Peershares/PeerCoin client.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/peerunity-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
 bin/32/peerunityd (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/peerunity-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
 bin/64/peerunityd (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 9901 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  PeerUnity works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps PeerUnity network.

To upgrade from 0.3, first backup wallet
peerunityd backupwallet <destination_backup_file>
Then shutdown peerunityd by
peerunityd stop
Uninstall v0.3 client, download and install v0.4 client.
Start up the new peerunityd (0.4.0).
If upgrade is performed after upgrade deadline then blockchain re-download
is required.
